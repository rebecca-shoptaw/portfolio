  `Hello! My name is Rebecca and I'm a freelance frontend web
    developer.`,
  `I bring from my background in filmmaking the combination of a
    strong visual sense and minute technical precision.`,
  `My training in programming began in the CS50 course in college
    back in 2015, for which I learned Javascript, HTML/CSS, C and
    SQL. For the final project, I taught myself Swift to build a
    video-editing app, and I was selected to be interviewed about the app at the year-end course fair.`,
  `Now, I'm focusing on frontend development, and using React
    with a mix of HTML, CSS, and Typescript to make
    beautiful and functional responsive sites and applications.`,
